# Batalha Rob√¥

This project was developed for the [Programming Lab course](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0216) during the second semester of 2017.

The assignment description is available in PDF. A report to the fourth page is available in Portuguese.

To compile the code, run:

`$ make
`

To delete the files generated during compilation, run:

`$ make clean
`

If you wish to change any argument in the test, it might be done in the .c file. The executable does not receive arguments. Execute it running:

`$ ./compila
`
